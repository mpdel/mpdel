** Summary

MPDel is an Emacs client for [[https://www.musicpd.org/][Music Player Daemon]] (MPD), a flexible,
powerful, server-side application for playing music. MPDel provides an
Emacs user interface to control playback (play, pause, next, volume
up…) and to display and control the current playlist as well as your
stored playlists (e.g., "my favorites", "wake me up", "make me dance",
…).

This is a screenshot of the current playlist with the
currently-playing song:

MPDel can show information about the currently playing song or any
other song:

[[file:media/mpdel-song.png]]

With the additional package [[https://gitlab.petton.fr/mpdel/ivy-mpdel.git][ivy-mpdel]], you can navigate your music
database and add songs to playlists with completion:

** Installing

Get mpdel from [[https://melpa.org/#/mpdel][melpa]] or [[https://stable.melpa.org/#/mpdel][melpa stable]]. You also need to install
[[https://gitlab.petton.fr/mpdel/libmpdel][libmpdel]].

You need to install and (quickly) configure an [[https://www.musicpd.org/][MPD server]] if you don't
have any yet. Don't worry, that's simple and you won't regret it.

** Using

Start by adding these lines to your ~init.el~ file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lib/mpdel")
  (require 'mpdel)
  (mpdel-mode)
#+END_SRC

Then, press ~C-x Z l~ to show the current playlist. The ~C-x Z~ global
prefix is configurable with ~mpdel-prefix-key~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq mpdel-prefix-key (kbd "C-. z"))
#+END_SRC

The following MPDel keybindings are available globally if ~mpdel-mode~
is active:

| *Binding*   | *Action*                                                  |
|-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
| ~C-x Z SPC~ | toggle between play and pause                             |
| ~C-x Z M-n~ | play next song                                            |
| ~C-x Z M-p~ | play previous song                                        |
| ~C-x Z l~   | open the current playlist                                 |
| ~C-x Z L~   | open a stored playlist                                    |
| ~C-x Z n~   | navigate your database from artists                       |
| ~C-x Z N~   | navigate your database from stored playlists              |
| ~C-x Z v~   | view current song                                         |
| ~C-x Z s r~ | search songs by artist name                               |
| ~C-x Z s l~ | search songs by album name                                |
| ~C-x Z s s~ | search songs by song title                                |
| ~C-x Z f~   | go forward current song by ~mpdel-song-normal-increment~  |
| ~C-x Z F~   | go forward current song by ~mpdel-song-small-increment~   |
| ~C-x Z M-f~ | go forward current song by ~mpdel-song-large-increment~   |
| ~C-x Z b~   | go backward current song by ~mpdel-song-normal-decrement~ |
| ~C-x Z B~   | go backward current song by ~mpdel-song-small-decrement~  |
| ~C-x Z M-b~ | go backward current song by ~mpdel-song-large-decrement~  |

The last component of each keybinding can also be pressed in any MPDel
buffer (e.g., press ~M-n~ in a playlist buffer to play the next song)
to do the same.  Additionally, the following keybindings are available
in all MPDel buffers where they make sense:

| *Binding* | *Action*                             |
|-----------+--------------------------------------|
| ~a~       | add item to current playlist         |
| ~A~       | add item to a stored playlist        |
| ~r~       | replace current playlist with item   |
| ~R~       | replace a stored playlist with item  |
| ~v~       | view currently played song           |
| ~RET~     | open a buffer showing item at point  |
| ~^~       | open item's parent                   |
| ~C-x C-j~ | open a dired buffer on item at point |

Opening a dired buffer on the item at point requires configuring
~libmpdel-music-directory~ first.

*** Navigator

The keybinding ~C-x Z n~ (or just ~n~ in any MPDel buffer) opens a
navigator on your database. You first get a list of all artists. From
there, you can press ~a~, ~A~, ~r~ or ~R~ (see above) to add the item
at point to a playlist. You can also press ~RET~ (the ~enter~ key) to
"dive" into the selected item and display a list of the artist's
albums. On the contrary, press ~^~ to go back to the item's parent
(e.g., artist of the album at point). Keybindings are also available
here to add albums to a playlist or dive into an album's songs. Diving
into a song displays some information about it.

You can also start a navigator on your stored playlists with ~C-x Z N~
(or just ~N~) but that's probably less useful than opening a stored
playlist buffer (with ~C-x Z L~ or just ~L~).

There is just one navigator buffer available at any time and its name
is ~*MPDEL Navigator*~.

*** Playlists

Playlist buffers display either the current playlist (~C-x Z l~ or
just ~l~) or any stored playlist (~C-x Z L~ or just ~L~). A playlist
buffer lists songs and can be edited.

Here is a list of keybindings available for playlist buffers:

| *Binding* | *Action*                                      |
|-----------+-----------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC~     | play song at point (only in current playlist) |
| ~k~       | removes selected song(s) from playlist        |
| ~M-up~    | move selected song(s) up in the playlist      |
| ~M-down~  | move selected song(s) down in the playlist    |

When a command acts on the selected song(s) (such as ~k~), the song at
point will be used if there is no active region and all songs of the
region will be used otherwise.

Playlist buffers are refreshed automatically when the MPD server
refreshes them.

*** Song

Song buffers display information about a song, either the currently
played one (~C-x Z v~ or just ~v~) or the song at point (with
~V~). When displaying the currently played song, the buffer also shows
playback status (e.g., "Currently playing") and current playback
position in song (e.g., "02:32 / 06:01"). Press ~^~ to open a
navigator on the song's album.
